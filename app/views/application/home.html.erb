<h1>Friends of Jack's Annual Summer Mixtape Competition</h1>

<p>Coming up in the next few weeks will be the start of our annual mixtape
competition. It's an awesome chance to showcase some really cool music and more
importantly listen to a lot of great music you likely haven't heard before. It's
a ton of fun, even if you don't have anything to contribute.</p>

<p><b>The deadline for entries is <%= Settings.contest.start.strftime("%A, %B, %-d, %Y by %r %Z") %>.</b> If
this does not work for you for some reason, talk to Dan and we'll figure
something out.</p>

<p>Here's a quick run-down on how the competition works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All mixtape submissions and comments are anonymous until the end of the
  competition.</li>
  <li>Making a mix is as easy as dragging audio files from your computer to the
  browser and re-arranging them as you want. The server will make sure
  everything is tagged properly!</li>
  <li>Your mix can have as many songs as you'd like but should be no longer than
  40 minutes. It's not a strict limit (i.e., you aren't disqualified at 40:01),
  but if you go over 40 minutes, it better be worth it.</li>
  <li>Some people like to mix songs into a single track. If you do this, be sure
  to upload each song individually too and place the single track mix
  first.</li>
  <li>Stand out songs and guesses don't mean anything. They're just for
  fun.</li>
  <li>Voting details to come later in the summer!</li>
</ul>
