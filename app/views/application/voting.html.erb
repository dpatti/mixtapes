<h1>Voting Procedure</h1>

<p>The end of summer party also marks the end of the mixtape competition, and
all votes and guesses are due before that day. This year's mixtape competition
ends on <%= Settings.contest.end.strftime("%A %B %-d") %> at 12:01 AM.</p>

<h2>How to submit your vote</h2>

To vote, you must send an email to our neutral vote tallier, Ian, in the format
provided. A sample submission has been provided below. Remember, everyone from
Fog Creek and Trello can vote! If you did not submit a mixtape, just say so on
the second line.

<p>
Here are the rules:
<ol>
  <li>Rank your <b>top three</b> mixes, <b>minimum</b>. You can rank as many as
  you want. Ties are allowed (see above example).</li>
  <li>You can rank as many mixes as you like.</li>
  <li>You can't vote for your own mix.</li>
  <li>You can't win if you don't vote.</li>
  <li>You can't vote if you didn't listen to all of the mixes. We can't verify
  this, but we trust that you are respectful of the others who have taken the
  time to put together a mix.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>How to submit your guesses</h2>

<p>Really?! It's in the top bar, silly. Here's <a href="/guesses">another
  link</a>. Just fill it out, and we can see who was the best guesser and who
had the most mysterious mix. And yeah, there are some double or triple names
there. Just pick one and don't worry about it.</p>
